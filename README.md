# Portfolio Website

I developed my portfolio website using TypeScript and React on the front-end, along with popular libraries such as react-hook-form, styled-components, and framer-motion. The website showcases my skills and projects in an interactive and visually appealing manner. For the back-end, I utilized Node.js and Express to create a robust and efficient server-side implementation.
